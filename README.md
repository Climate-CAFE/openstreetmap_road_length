# Road Length Sums using OpenStreetMap data


# Overview
[OpenStreetMap]([url](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about)) is a collaborative, open-source platform that provides maps and geographic data. It contains a wide range of types of geographic data, including buildings, roads, points of interest, and natural features, among others. It can be accessed from a number of sources. The historical data for the full planet is available, but is not recommended to download, as it is extremely large. A more convenient way to access OSM data is through [Geofabrik]([url](https://download.geofabrik.de/)), a consulting firm based in Germany that provides free files that are updated daily.
