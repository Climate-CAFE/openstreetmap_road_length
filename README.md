# Road Length Sums using OpenStreetMap data
This tutorial describes how to download and process OpenStreetMap roads data to calculate road sums by type for a particular administrative level. While the example code will calculate road sums for every municipality in each of Mexico's 32 states, it should be applicable for any country, as long as administrative levels are downloaded from GADM.

# Overview
[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about) is a collaborative, open-source platform that provides maps and geographic data. It contains a wide range of types of geographic data, including buildings, roads, points of interest, and natural features, among others. It can be accessed from a number of sources. The historical data for the full planet is available, but is not recommended to download, as it is extremely large. A more convenient way to access OSM data is through [Geofabrik](https://download.geofabrik.de/), a consulting firm based in Germany that provides free files that are updated daily. No purchase or membership is required to access either source.

To download data for a particular region or country, click on a region name to see the available sub-regions. Highlighting the name will also highlight each region on the map. For example, Mexico is part of North America rather than Central America.

Choose the shp.zip if it is available. It’s typically only available for smaller regions, such as individual countries. Click the link of the desired file format and it will directly download onto your local machine. Once it is downloaded, you can “decompress” or “unzip” the folder, which will open a folder with the contents of the compressed file. You should be aware that the unzipped folder will be larger than the zipped file. Ensure that you have roughly 6x the space available as the zipped file just to be safe. For example, the Mexico folder was 1.1GB when zipped and 3.3GB after unzipping. The folder will have a shapefile for each type of geographic data.
