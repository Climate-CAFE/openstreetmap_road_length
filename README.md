# Road Length Sums using OpenStreetMap data
This tutorial describes how to download and process OpenStreetMap roads data to calculate road sums by type for a particular administrative level. While the example code will calculate road sums for every municipality in each of Mexico's 32 states, it should be applicable for any country, as long as administrative levels are downloaded from GADM.

# Overview
[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about) is a collaborative, open-source platform that provides maps and geographic data. It contains a wide range of types of geographic data, including buildings, roads, points of interest, and natural features, among others. It can be accessed from a number of sources. The historical data for the full planet is available, but is not recommended to download, as it is extremely large. A more convenient way to access OSM data is through [Geofabrik](https://download.geofabrik.de/), a consulting firm based in Germany that provides free files that are updated daily. No purchase or membership is required to access either source.

To download data for a particular region or country, click on a region name to see the available sub-regions. Highlighting the name will also highlight each region on the map. For example, Mexico is part of North America rather than Central America.

Choose the shp.zip if it is available. It’s typically only available for smaller regions, such as individual countries. Click the link of the desired file format and it will directly download onto your local machine. Once it is downloaded, you can “decompress” or “unzip” the folder, which will open a folder with the contents of the compressed file. You should be aware that the unzipped folder will be larger than the zipped file. Ensure that you have roughly 6x the space available as the zipped file just to be safe. For example, the Mexico folder was 1.1GB when zipped and 3.3GB after unzipping. The folder will have a shapefile for each type of geographic data. For explanations and definitions of each map features, refer to the [OpenStreetMap wiki]([url](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_features)). The shapefile we would like to work with contains all road types: highways, local streets, unpaved tracks, and others. This file will be called "gis_osm_roads_free_1.shp" or something similar. 

To calculate road sums and intersections for a particular area within a country, we need shapefiles containing the administrative boundaries of that country. The source of this data we will use in the tutorial is from GADM (Global Administrative Areas Database), which provides geographic boundaries and information on administrative subdivisions for almost every country (or special region, such as American Samoa) in the world. Level 0 files contain an outline of the country/region itself. Level 1 files contain boundaries for the first-level administrative divisions, usually states, provinces, or regions. For example, the United States and Mexico both have states. Level 2 files contain boundaries for the second-level subdivisions within the first-level divisions, such as counties, districts, or municipalities. The United States has counties, but Mexico has municipalities. GADM provides both the local-language name and the English name for these subdivisions. Some countries have Level 3 subdivisions, such as Estonia which has boundaries for every city, town, and village. Our tutorial will calculate the road length sums by type for each Level 2 subdivision in Mexico, but could be adapted for Level 1 or 3 divisions in another country. To download this data, [select the country of choice]([url](https://gadm.org/download_country.html)) from the drop-down menu and select the "Shapefile" option. The Level 2 file will be called "gadm41_{country 3-letter abbreviation}_2.shp".
